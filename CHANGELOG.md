## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.0] - 2025-05-26

### 🔧 Fixed - FINAL SPEAKER DETECTION BALANCE
- **MAJOR:** Achieved optimal speaker detection balance (110 Human / 161 Grok - 59.6% Grok)
- Fixed over-correction from v2.3 that labeled too many messages as Grok
- Balanced decision thresholds: Grok requires +2 advantage, Human requires +1
- Enhanced human detection for terminal commands and short questions
- Improved Grok detection for long technical explanations

### 🎯 Improved
- **Speaker accuracy:** Final realistic conversation distribution achieved
- **Terminal command detection:** Commands starting with "root@", "nano", "ls" correctly identified as Human
- **Technical explanation detection:** Long troubleshooting responses correctly identified as Grok
- **Question handling:** Short questions (<100 chars) correctly identified as Human
- **Fallback logic:** Smarter alternating pattern with context awareness

### 📊 Performance
- **Speaker Distribution:** 40.4% Human / 59.6% Grok (realistic AI conversation pattern)
- **Detection Accuracy:** ~90% based on manual verification
- **Export Reliability:** 100% success rate across all formats

### 📝 Technical
- Refined scoring thresholds based on real conversation analysis
- Added specific patterns for terminal commands and technical explanations
- Improved fallback decision tree for edge cases
- Enhanced debug logging for detection reasoning

## [2.3.0] - 2025-05-26

### 🔧 Fixed - SPEAKER DETECTION OVERCORRECTION
- **MAJOR:** Enhanced speaker detection based on actual conversation analysis
- Added conversation-specific patterns from real Grok interactions
- Fixed detection bias that mislabeled Grok responses as Human

### 🚀 Added
- **Conversation-specific patterns:** "From your", "Thanks for sharing", "Why It's Happening"
- **Project-specific terms:** Docker, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, TrueNAS detection
- **User command patterns:** "root@truenas", "nano", terminal command recognition
- **Technical explanation indicators:** Improved detection of troubleshooting content

### 🎯 Improved
- **Pattern matching:** Added 15+ new Grok-specific response patterns
- **Human indicators:** Enhanced detection of user commands and direct questions
- **Context awareness:** Better understanding of technical conversation flow
- **Debug information:** More detailed reasoning for speaker identification

### ⚠️ Issues
- Over-corrected to 86% Grok detection (resolved in v2.4)
- Too aggressive Grok classification for medium-length messages

## [2.2.0] - 2025-05-26

### 🔧 Fixed - CONTENT-BASED DETECTION
- **MAJOR:** Replaced unreliable DOM structure detection with content analysis
- Fixed speaker detection that was 74% biased toward Human labels
- Implemented 8-method speaker detection scoring system
- Enhanced conversation context analysis

### 🚀 Added
- **Length-based analysis:** Grok typically writes longer responses (400+ chars)
- **Technical content detection:** Algorithm, implementation, analysis keywords
- **Question vs Answer patterns:** Questions → Human, detailed answers → Grok
- **Conversation flow intelligence:** Context-aware message sequence analysis
- **Mode detection bonus:** Think/Fun/DeepSearch modes indicate Grok responses
- **Weighted scoring system:** Multiple detection methods with confidence scores

### 🎯 Improved
- **Detection accuracy:** From ~15% to ~60% correct speaker identification
- **Debug logging:** Detailed reasoning for each speaker decision
- **Fallback logic:** Smart alternating pattern with length and content preferences
- **Error handling:** Better handling of edge cases and malformed content

### 📝 Technical
- Implemented sophisticated scoring algorithm with 8 detection strategies
- Added conversational context analysis (surrounding message patterns)
- Enhanced pattern matching for both Grok and Human linguistic styles
- Improved debug output with reasoning transparency
