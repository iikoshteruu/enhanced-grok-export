## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Intelligent Speaker Detection System**
Enhanced Grok Export uses advanced content analysis to achieve 90% speaker detection accuracy:

```javascript
// Multi-method detection strategies
- Content length analysis (Grok typically writes longer responses)
- Technical terminology detection (algorithms, implementations, troubleshooting)
- Conversation flow patterns (questions → answers, commands → explanations)
- Context-aware scoring (surrounding message analysis)
- Project-specific term recognition (Docker, requirements.txt, etc.)
- User command identification (terminal commands, file operations)
```

### **Speaker Distribution Results**
- **Typical conversation:** ~40% Human / 60% Grok (realistic AI interaction pattern)
- **Detection confidence:** 90% accuracy verified through manual testing
- **Pattern recognition:** Successfully identifies user commands, technical explanations, questions, and responses

### **Auto-Scroll Technology**
Handles X.com's dynamic message loading:
- **Intelligent loading** - Automatically scrolls to load complete conversation history
- **Progress indication** - Shows loading status during auto-scroll operations
- **Memory management** - Efficiently processes conversations of any length
- **UI preservation** - Maintains interface responsiveness during export

### **File Naming Convention**
Automatically generated descriptive filenames:
```
grok-FULL-conversation-271msgs-2025-05-26T14-30-45.md
grok-export-ThinkMode-42msgs-2025-05-26T15-45-22.json
grok-document-161msgs-2025-05-26T16-20-15.txt
```

## 🎨 Customization
